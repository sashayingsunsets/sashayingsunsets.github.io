  <p>I was on my way to school, sitting in my car at a red light. College street lights take a long time to turn green. </p>
  <p> so the wind just started blowing. </p>
  <p> and the trees started moving. a ton of leaves just started falling. </p>
  <p> slowly. </p>
  <p> all in a monochromatic orange. the guy in front of me was waving his hand out the window to a beat i couldn't hear. </p>
  <p> i was sitting there, preoccupied by a thought about the future. </p>
  <p>and this thought just came to me. </p>
  <p> it wasn't dramatic or anything. it was just, "this is beautiful." </p>
  <p>but i don't think I've had a moment these past few weeks where I've felt truly relaxed.
  <p>until that monochromatic orange. </p>
