      <p> A transcription of a text conversation and some thoughts. </p>
      <p> <b> 8:30 PM 2/21  </b> </p>
      <p> (Mom is deaf.) </p>
      <p>Mom: Hi I'm at kaiser ER they're not sure if I had a heart attack they will check on it so I may stay here overnight   </p>
      <p>C: how are you doing? is it severe?   </p>
      <p>  Mom: I'm okay my heart is now okay no more racing. I'm on IV. They're doing blood work now and keeping me overnight at urgent care   </p>
      <p>C: does it hurt?    </p>
      <p>Mom: Just discomfort on my chest and back   </p>
      <p>  C: do you have anyone supporting you?  </p>
      <p> Mom: No I'm here by myself but that's okay good thing I have this device to communicate. They did ekg and blood work so am waiting for results.  </p>
      <p> C: does (my sister) know?   </p>
      <p>Mom: Maybe it's a heart attack but I caught it early who knows. Yes she knows.    </p>
      <p>C: is she coming to visit?   </p>
      <p>Mom: She wanted to but told her to stay  </p>
      <p>  C: i don't think it's that out of the way for her. i think it's better for you to have someone there.   </p>
      <p>Mom: Im okay for now what will she do   </p>
      <p>  C: just be there for you. she doesn't need to do anything specific. </p>
      <p>Mom: Let's wait and see what the doctor says when he has the results   </p>
      <p><b>10:30 PM 2/21  </b></p>
      <p>M: Can I talk with you on skype  </p>
      <p>C: yeah   </p>
      <p></p>
      <p> “Mom, won’t you hug me once more? You are so far away. I don’t want you to go just yet.
      I know the doctor said nothing was wrong but you have now revealed to me that you have weaknesses, that you can be sick. <p>
      I am not prepared for this realization. What comes next?" </p>

        <p>I was on my way to school, sitting in my car at a red light. College street lights take a long time to turn green. </p>
        <p> so the wind just started blowing. </p>
        <p> and the trees started moving. a ton of leaves just started falling. </p>
        <p> slowly. </p>
        <p> all in a monochromatic orange. the guy in front of me was waving his hand out the window to a beat i couldn't hear. </p>
        <p> i was sitting there, preoccupied by a thought about the future. </p>
        <p>and this thought just came to me. </p>
        <p> it wasn't dramatic or anything. it was just, "this is beautiful." </p>
        <p>but i don't think I've had a moment these past few weeks where I've felt truly relaxed.
        <p>until that monochromatic orange. </p>

      <p>Flickering eyelashes, like fireflies, caught in the heat of a thick summer night. Flashing a dim hazel, the taste of a soapy bubble mix lingered. </p>
      <p>Her eyes waded through the air itself. Her smile peeled apart the summer heat.   </p>
      <p>She held a piece of paper between her fingers and held it like one would hold a children's drawing.</p>
      <P> Picking detail by detail, looking for a word to say. When the only words that could be shared, were conveyed with the filling silence. </p>
