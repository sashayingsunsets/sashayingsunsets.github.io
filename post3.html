      <p> (Mom is deaf.) </p>
      <p>Mom: Hi I'm at kaiser ER they're not sure if I had a heart attack they will check on it so I may stay here overnight   </p>
      <p>C: how are you doing? is it severe?   </p>
      <p>  Mom: I'm okay my heart is now okay no more racing. I'm on IV. They're doing blood work now and keeping me overnight at urgent care   </p>
      <p>C: does it hurt?    </p>
      <p>Mom: Just discomfort on my chest and back   </p>
      <p>  C: do you have anyone supporting you?  </p>
      <p> Mom: No I'm here by myself but that's okay good thing I have this device to communicate. They did ekg and blood work so am waiting for results.  </p>
      <p> C: does (my sister) know?   </p>
      <p>Mom: Maybe it's a heart attack but I caught it early who knows. Yes she knows.    </p>
      <p>C: is she coming to visit?   </p>
      <p>Mom: She wanted to but told her to stay  </p>
      <p>  C: i don't think it's that out of the way for her. i think it's better for you to have someone there.   </p>
      <p>Mom: Im okay for now what will she do   </p>
      <p>  C: just be there for you. she doesn't need to do anything specific. </p>
      <p>Mom: Let's wait and see what the doctor says when he has the results   </p>
      <p><b>10:30 PM 2/21  </b></p>
      <p>M: Can I talk with you on skype  </p>
      <p>C: yeah   </p>
      <p></p>
      <p> “Mom, won’t you hug me once more? You are so far away. I don’t want you to go just yet. I know the doctor said nothing was wrong but you have now revealed to me that you have weaknesses, that you can be sick. I am not prepared for this realization. What comes next?" </p>
