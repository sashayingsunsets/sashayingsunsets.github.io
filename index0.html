i keep thinking about my past

about who i was

and who i am now

there’s a lot of time to think about that in the quiet moments

i think about the difference between who i was and who i am now

i changed a lot between the ages of 14 and 18

i changed even more between the ages of 18 and 23

that first transition, i remember envisioning the world as a tree and myself as a weightless entity disconnected from it all, i could not touch the roots, feel the weight of being human, days passed quickly

and then one day i could touch the roots, i could feel everything, it was overwhelming

i tried new things, i went to concerts, made friends that i could go to restaurants with, wrote poetry, it felt like i was learning how to live

and at the same time, it felt like i was running away from home, that all of these moments placed me outside of that space, they gave me the freedom to run away

i gained the strength to pack up and move to another state

i stumbled my first few years there but when things settled, i realized that threat no longer existed, the reasons for my new life were so tied to that craving for escape, that without the need to escape, i hid and hid, i built a nest in my home and became confused, my reasons for ‘being’ dramatically changed

becoming okay with that was hard, i wrote less, i read less, i did less

life was not better before this, it was a means to an end, a taste of what i can be, going out was gently guided by my trauma and when that trauma was lost, i collapsed

i need to learn how to be again, or rather, i need to learn a new way to be, and this time, i can shape this metamorphosis the way i want it to look, my reasons for being do not need to be shaped by that craving for escape

but how?

an out of tune piano can be tuned by someone with the know-how, the piano can reclaim its notes and produce melodies again

can i find a melody to lay my reason for ‘being’ on that isn’t the trauma i once based my excitement for life on?

i hope so.

        <p>I was on my way to school, sitting in my car at a red light. College street lights take a long time to turn green. </p>
        <p> so the wind just started blowing. </p>
        <p> and the trees started moving. a ton of leaves just started falling. </p>
        <p> slowly. </p>
        <p> all in a monochromatic orange. the guy in front of me was waving his hand out the window to a beat i couldn't hear. </p>
        <p> i was sitting there, preoccupied by a thought about the future. </p>
        <p>and this thought just came to me. </p>
        <p> it wasn't dramatic or anything. it was just, "this is beautiful." </p>
        <p>but i don't think I've had a moment these past few weeks where I've felt truly relaxed.
        <p>until that monochromatic orange. </p>

      <p>Flickering eyelashes, like fireflies, caught in the heat of a thick summer night. Flashing a dim hazel, the taste of a soapy bubble mix lingered. </p>
      <p>Her eyes waded through the air itself. Her smile peeled apart the summer heat.   </p>
      <p>She held a piece of paper between her fingers and held it like one would hold a children's drawing.</p>
      <P> Picking detail by detail, looking for a word to say. When the only words that could be shared, were conveyed with the filling silence. </p>
